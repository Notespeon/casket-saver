# Casket Saver
Inspired by Impling Saver, Casket Saver will switch the right click "open" option on caskets of all tiers to "use" if a Master Clue has been found in your inventory or bank.

Limitations:
- Closing the Bank on the same tick as a master clue is added to the bank will cause the plugin to forget about the clue.
- Spam clicking too fast (more than once per tick) may cause additional caskets to be opened after recieving a master clue.
