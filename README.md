# Casket Saver
Inspired by Impling Saver, Casket Saver prevents opening caskets while player is ineligible to receive a master clue.

Limitations:
- Closing the Bank on the same tick as a master clue is added to the bank will cause the plugin to forget about the clue.
- Spam clicking too fast (more than once per tick) may cause additional caskets to be opened after receiving a master clue.
    - Use the 'Spamming cooldown' config option to avoid this behavior.
