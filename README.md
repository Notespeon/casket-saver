# Casket Saver
Inspired by Impling Saver, Casket Saver will switch the right click "open" option on caskets of all tiers to "use" if a Master Clue has been found in your inventory or bank.

Limitations:
- Closing the Bank on the same tick as a master clue is added to the bank will cause the plugin to forget about the clue.
- Clues that haven't yet been added to the inventory may not count, causing an extra casket to sometimes be opened after obtaining a master clue when spam clicking.
