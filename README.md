# Casket Saver
Casket Saver blocks casket opening while a master clue is possessed by the player.

Limitations:
- Spam clicking too fast (more than once per tick) may cause additional caskets to be opened after receiving a master clue.
    - Use the 'Spamming cooldown' config option to avoid this behavior.
